#Introduction:
MultiLayerNavigation helps you implemntation the interaction -- 'drag to back' in a easy way.
The only one thing you need to do is replacing your UINavigationController with the MLNavigation Controller. 
In addtion, if there are a scroll view in your ViewController, you need to do one more thing -- replace the UIScrollView with MLScrollView or inherit it, that's all.

#Known Issue
1.NOT fully some scrollable view (webview/textview/tableview) yet.
